# Webapps

### Getting Started With Django

http://djangoproject.com/

##### Project Spec

I will write a web app called Learning Log that allows me to log the
topics I'm interested in and to make journal entries as I learn
about each topic.

The Learning Log home page should describe the site
and invite other users to either register or log in.

Once logged in, a user should be able to create new topics,
add new entries, and read and edit existing entries.

##### 



##### Developer Notes

- Django will be available only when the environment is active.

directory learning_log
    source 11_env/bin/activate
    python manage.py runserver
        (the focus here is the manage.py file)

directory learning_logs
