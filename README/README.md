# Webapps

### Getting Started With Django

http://djangoproject.com/

##### Project Spec

I will write a web app called Learning Log that allows me to log the
topics I'm interested in and to make journal entries as I learn
about each topic.

The Learning Log home page should describe the site
and invite other users to either register or log in.

Once logged in, a user should be able to create new topics,
add new entries, and read and edit existing entries.


##### Developer Notes

- Django will be available only when the environment is active.

directory learning_log
    `source 11_env/bin/activate`
    `python manage.py runserver`
        (the focus here is to run the manage.py file)

directory learning_logs
    git root folder

- Book states the following: 
    If youâ€™re using Python 2.7, you should call the
    __str__() method__unicode__() instead. The body of the
    method is identical.
    
- In REALITY, python 2.7 can take the __str__() method and return
the properly given string.

- Django APIs
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/

- Django 2.0 removes the `django.core.urlresolvers` module, which was
moved to django.urls in version 1.10. Change any import to use
django.urls instead, like this: `django.urls import reverse`
